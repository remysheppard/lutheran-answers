In this episode, my Dear Brother in Christ Stuart Keenan comes on to discuss what it was like to grow up Baptist, and the ways in which they get things right that Lutherans sometimes get wrong. 

We should never grow complacent in our faith, and there are many things we can learn from other expressions of Christianity that can benefit us. I hope this episode is as fun and informative for you to listen to as it was for me to record it!
