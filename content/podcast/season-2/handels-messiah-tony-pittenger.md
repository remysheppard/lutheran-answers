Pastor Tony Pittenger, of the ELS, wrote an incredibly detailed study of Handel's Messiah, accompanied by some beautiful custom artwork. In this episode I get to sit down and speak with him about what, in his words, started as a lazy way out of a Bible study, and ended up being an all-consuming obsession.
