**Philosophy for the People** host Pat Flynn joins me to discuss the philosophical arguments for God, the problem of evil, and classical Christian thought. It was such a great time, and I really enjoyed listening to Pat on these subjects.

He was so kind and patient explaining philosophical concepts to me, and while it felt like drowning from time to time, it was so enlightening and I learned so much.

I hope you enjoy this episode!
