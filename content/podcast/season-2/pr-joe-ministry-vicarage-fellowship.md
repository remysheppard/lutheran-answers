After a ton of begging, schedule checking, and Sunday nagging, I was finally able to get my own pastor, Joe Christina, to come on the podcast!

Joe and I talk about tons of things! Vicars and vicarage, ministry and its challenges, the armed forces, what it's like to live where we live, Christian fellowship, and more!

With this episode you get to listen to what a real conversation between my pastor and me sounds like.
