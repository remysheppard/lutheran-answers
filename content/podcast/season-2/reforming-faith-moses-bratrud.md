This week I had the pleasure of interviewing the wonderful Moses Bratrud on his journey to Lutheranism from Dutch Reformed theology. 

We had such a great time talking about Reformed Theology vs Lutheran Theology, Anglicanism, Pentecostalism, and the various ways in which we impact theology and it impacts us.

I hope you enjoy this episode!
