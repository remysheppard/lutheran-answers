Listen along as I talk with Tabitha Edwards about her journey through the wilderness, and how she came out of Charismatic and New Age beliefs into the comforting arms of Christ. 

Tabby grew up Charismatic, watching word of faith televangelists, and that led her down a path of polytheism, new age ideas, and all sorts of dangerous places. Eventually our Lord Jesus found her and brought her into the Lutheran Church, where she has found great peace and comfort.

I hope her story is inspirational to you, and I hope you learn a lot from it!
