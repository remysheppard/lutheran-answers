On this episode I sit down with Noelyn Meckle (**[@SKOLMister](https://www.x.com/SKOLMister)**) to discuss his journey from progressive Lutheranism and the ELCA to conservative Lutheranism and the LCMS. We had a really great time talking, and covered quite a few topics, and shared a lot of good laughs.

I hope you enjoy listening!
