Pastor Garen Pay, author of an amazing Zombie novel, stops by to discuss life, literature, and theology with me!

If you haven't read it, Pastor Pay's book EccleZia is about a small town pastor who has to shepherd his family and his flock through the zombie apocalypse. It's a great book that I had a very hard time putting down. It's jam packed with solid action, great zombie stuff, comforting theology, and a beautiful story.

Make sure you pick up a copy of his book today!
